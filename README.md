# Kaggle-dataset-exploration-with-python
 
**Description:**

This repository documents my journey into learning the fundamentals of Pandas library through exploring the London Bike Sharing dataset from Kaggle. The Jupyter notebook showcases various operations like analyzing column values, converting data types, data mapping, and exporting the final results to an Excel sheet.

**Dataset:**

* **Source:** <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset>
* **Description:** This dataset contains hourly information about individual bike hires and returns for the London Bicycle Sharing System.

**Technical Stack:**

* **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive coding environment for data exploration and visualization.
* **Kaggle library:** Python library for downloading datasets from Kaggle.
* **Zipfile library:** Used to extract data from the downloaded zip file.
* **Pandas library:** Powerful data analysis and manipulation library.

**Project Objectives:**

* Gain practical experience with Pandas library functions.
* Explore and analyze columns within the dataset.
* Learn data cleaning techniques like converting data types and mapping values.
* Export the final processed data to an Excel sheet.

**Key Learnings:**

* Converted numerical values like humidity to percentages for better interpretation.
* Mapped numerical season and weather codes to meaningful names for clarity.
* Exported the cleaned and processed data to an Excel sheet for further analysis or sharing.

**Challenges Faced:**

* Understanding the nuances of different Pandas functions and data structures.

**Future Improvements:**

* Implement more advanced data analysis techniques (e.g., correlations, groupby operations).
* Create interactive visualizations within the Jupyter notebook.
* Automate the data cleaning and processing steps.

**Additional Notes:**

* The Jupyter notebook (`London_bikes.ipynb`) contains the detailed code and explanations for each step.
* The processed Excel sheet (`london_bikes_final.xlsx`) is included in the repository for reference.
